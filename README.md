Here are some assembly code modifications I created for Mario Kart 8 Wii U.

Currently, most of them are designed for version 4.1 of the game unless stated otherwise. I will port them to version 4.2 when I have time.

In their current format, they are meant to be loaded with TCPGecko. I intend to convert them to a different format so they can be loaded with [CodePatchPlugin](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/CodePatchPlugin) in the future.
